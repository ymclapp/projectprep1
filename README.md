# Conflict Plan
Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

## Describe at least:

1. What is the group process to resolve conflict, when it arises?  Take a break, step away, get the group together to understand the issue, resolve the issue in a manner that all parties can work with

2. How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?  Through the project work Trello cards, project manager handing out and checking on those, and the daily stand ups, as a group, we should be able to see where everything stands.  If there is a question on project work lagging, the project manager can reach out to the individual(s) to see how things are going and if any assistance is needed.  Escalating beyond this may be consulting with the 301 instructor.

3. How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?  See above

# Communication Plan
Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

## Describe at least:

1. How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?  Via Slack
2. What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?  Daily stand ups, listening to everyone, and communicating professionally to ensure you are heard
3. How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?  See above

# Work Plan
Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

## Describe at least:

1. How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?  Daily stand ups and Trello
2. What project management tool will be used? Trello

# Git Process
Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

## Describe at least:

1. What components of your project will live on GitHub?  We think, all of them, except Trello project work and Slack communications
2. How will you share the repository with your teammates?  We will add each person as a contributor
3. What is your Git flow? ACP and everyone on a branch relative to their assignment(s)
4. Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:  We are hoping to have a couple people that review the pull requests and agree together that they are ready to merge.
5. How many people must review a PR?  See above
6. Who merges PRs?  See above
7. How often will you merge?  As agreed upon based on what is being pushed (pull request).
8. How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?  Hopefully via Remo while we are working together, otherwise on Slack.
